Lab 1 Report:


We had to create an Interpreter which would interpret some basic statements such as variable declaration, computations on variables and printing statements. I did the code in java. The unit tests for this lab were made using JUnit test cases.  The code takes inputs from file. I read the file and put each line i.e statement in list. 
 
Code parses each statement in list checks it is declaration statement, print or compute statement then passes it to suitable functions.
Functions are print, declare and compute.

I have implemented test case of reading from file populating list and pass on to parse function.
